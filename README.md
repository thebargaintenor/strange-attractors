# strange-attractors
Generates images of dynamical system attractors

For now, it's hard coded to a single [Clifford attractor](https://blbadger.github.io/clifford-attractor.html) (or [these](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/clifford/) too). Once it can take input parameters, I'll see about modeling some other attractor systems too.
